# Discord-Bot-public
The Public access version of Sam

For my Capstone, I am coding and designing a discord bot. It will be from scratch in the programming language Python. I will be using Python 3.9 throughout the process and am using a module called discord.py. I taught myself how to use this module and program with it and have already made 2 bots with it that are discontinued. The code for the bot will take around 1-2000 lines of code all written by me. I want to do a form of programming when I get out of school and find a good job. I was good at programming at the start and it just clicked with me. It is missing the ID of the bot as to not get it hacked.
